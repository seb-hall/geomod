//  geomod, a geometric modelling kernel by seb hall

//  --- Motivation ---
//
//  The CAD software industry is dominated by highly
//  proprietary and heavily licenced products, many
//  of which only support Microsoft Windows and run
//  poorly on all but the latest and most expensive
//  hardware. There is also a very wide range of
//  software intended for slightly different applic-
//  ations and marketed separately, despite sharing
//  a lot of functonality.
//
//  geomod aims to solve these issues by targeting
//  many different markets at the same time, while
//  while supporting all platforms and placing a big 
//  focus on efficiency and stability. Best of all, 
//  it's open-source and available to use in any project, 
//  including proprietary ones!
//
//  --- Features ---
//
//  geomod is a hybrid geometric kernel, designed for 
//  both solid-style modelling, (e.g mechanical CAD) as 
//  well as mesh-style modelling (e.g animation, game 
//  design). It also features a heirarchical layout
//  system, as well as advanced model loading and rendering. 
//  Intended applications include mechanical and 
//  architectural CAD software, animation design and
//  surface modelling applications. geomod is also
//  designed to act as a fully-featured game engine.
