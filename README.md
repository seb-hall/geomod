# geomod

a new geometric modelling kernel

## overview

geomod aims to provide an open-source, alternative geometric modelling kernel for the 21st century. 
It intends to combine the capabilities of traditional solid CAD with mesh-based CAD, 
providing a highly versatile basis for adaptive design software.

Built with Rust, geomod focuses on stability and performance, and is intended for a wide variety of applications.

Examples include:
- 2D & 3D CAD
- Simulation Software
- AR/VR Software
- Game and Animation Design
